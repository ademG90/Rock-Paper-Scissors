# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript.
The game allows two players to compete against each other by choosing one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors.
The winner is determined based on the rules of the game: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

## Gameplay

1. The game will prompt Player 1 to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors).

2. Once Player 1 has made their choice, the game will prompt Player 2 to enter their choice.
